## üöÄ **Quick Start**

### **Requirements**
- **C++20 compatible compiler** (GCC 10+, Clang 12+, MSVC 2022+)
- **CMake 3.20+** (optional, for project integration)
- **OpenGL development libraries** (optional, for graphics)

### **Build & Test**
```bash
# Basic compilation (framework only)
g++ -std=c++20 -O3 -DPIX_ENABLE_TESTS pix_engine_final.cpp -lpthread

# With OpenGL support (Linux)
g++ -std=c++20 -O3 -DPIX_ENABLE_TESTS -DPIX_ENABLE_OPENGL pix_engine_final.cpp -lpthread -lGL -lX11

# Windows with OpenGL
cl /std:c++20 /O2 /DPIX_ENABLE_TESTS /DPIX_ENABLE_OPENGL pix_engine_final.cpp /link opengl32.lib ws2_32.lib

# Run tests
./pix_engine_final
```

### **Integration Example**
```cpp
#include "pix_engine_final.cpp"

// Use the framework in your application
pix::core::Engine engine;
engine.initialize();

// Create physics world
pix::physics::PhysicsWorld world;
auto* body = world.create_body(pix::math::Vec3(0, 10, 0), 1.0f);

// Use graphics abstraction
pix::graphics::GraphicsContext context(pix::graphics::GraphicsAPI::OpenGL);
auto shader = context.create_shader();

// Your application logic here...
```
