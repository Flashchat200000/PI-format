PIX is a high-performance, security-first file format designed for the next generation of web graphics. It combines procedural generation, cryptographic integrity, and a unique dual-mode architecture for universal compatibility.
PIX is not just another image format. It's a container that describes how to generate content, rather than just storing static pixels. This allows for incredibly rich, dynamic, and interactive graphics to be delivered in a minimal footprint, without compromising on security or performance.

Key Features

üîê Cryptography-First Security: Every PIX file is protected by a mandatory cryptographic signature (e.g., ECDSA, RSA - specific provider is pluggable). The signature of the compressed data block is verified before any decompression or parsing occurs, mitigating a wide range of attacks. This is not CRC32; this is enterprise-grade integrity and authenticity.

üß† Procedural Rendering: At its core, PIX stores a graph of procedural nodes, not just pixels. This means complex textures, gradients, and shapes can be described as a recipe in a few kilobytes, enabling infinite resolution and dynamic content.

üîÑ Smart/Dumb Client Architecture: PIX solves the adoption problem with a built-in fallback cache. A "dumb" client (like a standard <img> tag) can display a simple preview, while a "smart" client (with the WASM renderer) can unlock the full, dynamic, procedural content.

üöÄ Performance via WebAssembly: The core parsing and rendering logic is written in modern C++ for maximum performance and memory safety. It's compiled to a lightweight WebAssembly module, allowing it to run securely and efficiently in any modern browser.

Architectural Overview

PIX is designed for robustness and efficiency. The file structure and parsing logic are built to be secure and fast.

File Structure

The file is structured to allow for immediate verification and lazy loading. The footer is read first to locate critical sections.



Secure Loading & Parsing Logic

The SceneReader follows a strict, security-conscious procedure:

 code
1. Read Footer -> Get offsets for Data Block and Signature.
2. Read Header -> Get metadata (e.g., compression type).
3. Read Compressed Data Block into memory.
4. Read Signature Chunk.
5. --> VERIFY SIGNATURE of the compressed block. <-- CRITICAL STEP
6. If verification passes:
7.    Decompress data block into an in-memory stream.
8.    Parse the master object index.
9.    Lazily parse individual objects from the stream on demand.

Technical Specifications

Signature: PIX3 (v26)

Core Chunks: TREE (Scene Tree), NODE (Procedural Graph), MESH (3D Data), SCPT (Scripts), INDX (Master Index), SIGN (Signature).

Data Integrity: Cryptographic signature verification via a pluggable ICryptoProvider.

Architecture: Append-only friendly structure with a master index for fast object lookups.

Compatibility: Dual-mode access via fallback cache and full procedural rendering.
