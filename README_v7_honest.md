- **Anyone expecting Unity/Unreal-level functionality**

## 💡 **Real Value Proposition**

### **Time Savings (6-12 months)**
- ✅ **Architecture setup**: No need to design Result<T>, lifecycle management
- ✅ **Memory management**: LRU cache with fallbacks already implemented
- ✅ **Threading infrastructure**: Shared mutexes and atomics properly used
- ✅ **Testing framework**: Custom unit testing with registration system
- ✅ **Logging system**: Multi-level with timestamps and categories

### **What You Still Need to Build**
- 🔨 **Graphics renderer**: 6-8 months of OpenGL/Vulkan work
- 🔨 **Physics engine**: 4-6 months for real collision detection
- 🔨 **Asset pipeline**: 3-4 months for importers and optimization
- 🔨 **Audio system**: 2-3 months for 3D audio processing
- 🔨 **Editor tools**: 8-12 months for visual debugging interface

## 🚀 **Quick Start & Integration**

### **Build & Test**
```bash
# Compile with tests (Linux/macOS)
g++ -std=c++20 -O3 -DPIX_ENABLE_TESTS pix_engine_simple.cpp -lpthread -o pix_engine

# Run framework tests
./pix_engine
```

### **Integration Example**
```cpp
#include "pix_engine_simple.cpp"

int main() {
    // Initialize framework
    pix::framework::SimpleEngine engine;
    auto result = engine.initialize();
    
    if (!result.has_value()) {
        std::cerr << "Failed: " << result.error() << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }
    
    // Create mesh resources
    std::vector<pix::math::Vec3> vertices = {{0,1,0}, {-1,-1,0}, {1,-1,0}};
    std::vector<uint32_t> indices = {0, 1, 2};
    
    auto mesh_id = engine.createMesh("Triangle", vertices, indices);
    auto mesh = engine.getMesh(mesh_id);
    
    // Use Result<T> error handling
    if (!mesh.has_value()) {
        std::cerr << "Mesh not found" << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }
    
    // Access cached data with automatic fallbacks
    std::cout << "Mesh: " << (*mesh)->name 
              << " (" << (*mesh)->vertices.size() << " vertices)" << std::endl;
    
    engine.shutdown();
    return 0;
}
```
